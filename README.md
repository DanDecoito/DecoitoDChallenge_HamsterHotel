I peer reveiew Daniel's Hamster Hotel, and had a chance to look over its entirety. Firs off its fully completed, from top to bottom, and that is great news., so good job there.  A few things that I noticed, were minimal to some extend but worth sharing.
Welcome to Hamster's Paradise section, there seems to be missing lenght space between the 3 logos, that occupy the bottom space. The first paragraph of the Hamster Paradise, aligns a little differently that the prototype. The prototype uses 2 lines for text, Dan used up 3 lines. 
The reserve room / check availabilty section of the site, is not interactive. The Check availiabilty button is not styled to meet to the prototype. 
As far as responsiveness, from my untrained eye, it feels as though the page is closing and cruntching too much when inspecting in the inspector tool. 
Besides all this acknowledgments of what needs work, the site well mirrors the prototype., and that in itself is a good thing. Way to go Dan!
